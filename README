Twittermancy
============

Twittermancy is a simple tool for performing divination using Twitter (http://twitter.com). You can access a live working version of Twittermancy at http://twittermancy.com.

Twittermancy is written using the Sinatra microframework. It's deployed using Capistrano. If you intend to deploy this application yourself, you'll need to edit config/deploy.rb (the Capistrano configuration) and config/googleanalytics.yml (if you're not planning to use Google Analytics, you can remove this file).
